Description:
    This will generate a .travis.yml file that you can use with travis-ci.org to listen to your repo's master branch, and on every commit, run `yeoman build` and commit the built site to your repo's gh-pages branch.

Example:
    yeoman init travis-ci:gh-pages

    This will create:
        .travis.yml
