Description:
    This will generate a .travis.yml file that you can use with travis-ci.org to listen to your repo's master branch. On every commit, travis-ci will run `grunt` and if your tests pass and the build is successful, the built site will be committed to your repo's gh-pages branch (will create the branch if necessary).

Example:
    yo travis-ci:gh-pages

    This will create:
        .travis.yml
